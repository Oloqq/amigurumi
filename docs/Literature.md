# [A 3D Skeletonization Algorithm for 3D Mesh Models Using a Partial Parallel 3D Thinning Algorithm and 3D Skeleton Correcting Algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/7/2/139)

There are three major skeletonization methodologies used in the literature
- distance transform field-based methods
  - extract a skeleton with missing branches
- voronoi diagram methods
  - extract a great number of spurious skeletal branches that are not essential for compact representation of the model
  - time consuming process
- thinning-based methods
  - faster than the Voronoi
  - more detailed skeletons than do those extracted by the field-based methods

However, the existing algorithms cannot preserve the connectivity of the skeletons of the 3D mesh models. The proposed algorithm can extract the skeleton of each branch of a model and preserve the connectivity.

Various methods of extracting 3D model features have been proposed by many researchers [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

3D skeleton-based approaches have attracted much attention [5,6,7,8,9,10]

There are three major skeletonization methodologies used in the literature:
- distance transform field-based methods [13,14,15],
- Voronoi diagram-based methods [16,17,18],
- and thinning-based methods [19,20,21,22,23]

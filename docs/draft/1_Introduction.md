# 1. Introduction

Crocheting is a manual craft that involves weaving a yarn stitch by stitch to create a piece of fabric. The craft is commonly confused with knitting, although the techniques are vastly different.

Crocheting makes it easy to create 3-dimensional shapes, and the pieces are generally sturdier than knitted ones, making the technique well suited for things that should keep their shape such as decorations or toys.

This project focuses on using crocheting to create 3-dimentional, stuffed shapes, an art called [amigurumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amigurumi).

The person crocheting, works by following a *pattern* that describes the sequence of stitches necessary to achieve a certain shape. Designing such a pattern is trivial for axially symmetrical shapes, but otherwise requires much trial and error.

There are currently no tools that could help with designing such shapes. The closest thing is [Crochet Lathe](https://avtanski.net/projects/crochet/lathe/), however the tool is only applicable to simple, axially symmetrical shapes.

## 1.1 Objectives

The goal of this project is to create a tool, that would let an artist visualize the plushie that their pattern produces before commiting hours into actually crocheting it.

## 1.2 Overview
Section 2 describes how a crochet piece is built. It describes the techniques referenced later in the work, and the considerations necessary to handle them in proposed algorithms.

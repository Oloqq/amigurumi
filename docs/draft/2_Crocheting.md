link section 4 as more formal representation

> working starts from a circle (MR/Ch)\
> worked in rounds\
> define basic stitches (sc, inc, dec)\
> sharper corner are made with back loop only, front loop only (BLO, FLO)\
> explain fasten off (FO)\
> hook can be reinserted into a plushie (grzib is a good example)\
> branches are created with chains and gotos\

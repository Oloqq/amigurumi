## Overview
Two kinds of forces need to act on a Plushie. First one, *link force*, shall try to keep connected stitches at a specific distance from one another. Second one, *stuffing force*, shall simulate the effect of stuffing inside the piece on the fabric. The first force is trivial, but for the second one, we need to get a notion on where is the inside of the Plushie.
<!-- TODO -->
Two approaches are explored for *stuffing force*.

## Initial node positions
- $N$ stores 3D vectors representing the positions of nodes in the graph. The positions can be set arbitrarily at this stage.
$$N: I \rightarrow \R^3$$

<!-- TODO cylinder vs one by one -->

## Stich-to-stitch force

## Centroid stuffing

## Skeleton-based stuffing

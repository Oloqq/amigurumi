# Verifying feasibility

- Create a model with Fusion360
- save as STL
- run model_preprocessing/preprocess.py
  - visualization of the cloud is possible
- confirm that the pointcloud is properly scaled and centered
  -  `cargo run dev 5`, path is hardcoded in `main.rs`
- handcraft a solution as a flow in `examples.rs`
  - use  `cargo run dev 5` to compare it to the pointcloud, adjust both so they fit
- adjust parameters for the simulation
  - with `cargo run dev 5`, hit `Animate`, the handcrafter thing must fit the pointcloud AND STOP simulating
  - most notable: max relaxing iterations and max tension
- use those parameters in `src\rocket_server\rank.rs`
- use the json of pointcloud in `src\rocket_server.rs:main`
- adjust evolver
  - number of actions
  - genetic parameters
- start the ranking server `cargo run dev 8`
  - it is way faster with release build
    - `cargo build --release`
    - `.\target\release\crocheteer.exe dev 8`
- start the evolution in `evolver`
- inspect the population with `cargo run inspect ...`

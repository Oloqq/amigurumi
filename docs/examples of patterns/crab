Embroider the eyes.

R1-R16. Begin by placing a pin in the middle of the piece, between R12/13. Thread a long piece of embroidery floss into an embroidery needle and knot one end. On the inside of the head, pick up a bit of yarn with your needle and make a knot. Begin to embroider into the 2nd stitch to the right/left of the pin.

Insert your needle one round up and one stitch over between R11/12.

Go up through a stitch on R12/13 (leaving one stitch open between eyes) and back down through the stitch on R11/12.

Go back up through a corner stitch of the eye to start the eyelashes.

Insert your needle one round up to make the first eyelash.

Go back up through the corner of the eye and move your needle up to make the second eyelash. Secure with a knot on the inside of the head.

Repeat on the other side. Begin to embroider into the 2nd stitch to the right/left of the pin.

Begin to make the smile by going into the stitch next to the eye on R12/13. And then moving down and over one stitch on R13/14.

Go up through R12/13, leaving one stitch open between the smile.

Go back down through the same stitch of R13/14. Make a knot on the inside of the head.
R17: (dec, sc in next 2 sts) 8 times {24 sts}
Begin to stuff the head and continue as you crochet. Make sure not to overstuff. You want the top and bottom to lay flat.
R18: (dec, sc) 8 times {16 sts}
R19: (dec) 8 times {8 sts}

Fasten off and leave a long piece of yarn to sew the head shut.
